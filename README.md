Configs
=======

This is the configuration I use on every server and on my personal computes to get the basic tools I need to work with Bash + Vim 

# Installation
Simply run `install.sh` to override your current `.vim` `.vimrc/` and `.bash_profile`. Your old config files will be moved to ~/.configs.old
