Configs
=======

Get the best of Vim in just three commands. This package includes a verry nice `.vimrc` (i can say it’s nice becasue I didn’t write it, [Jeffray Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay) did), and the most usefull vim plugins, including:
- auto-pairs
- ctrlp.vim.git
- emmet-vim
- html5.vim
- nerdtree
- vim-multiple-cursors
- vim-powerline
- vim-snipmate
- vim-surround
- … and much more

# Installation
- Clone this repository recursively with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/hpkns/configs`
- Cd to the newly cloned repo: `cd configs`
- Run `install.sh` to override your current `.vim` and `vimrc/`. Your old config files will be moved to `~/.configs.old`.
